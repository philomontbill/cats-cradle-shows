            <h1>Soundcheck</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Currently featuring: Cat's Cradle, Carrboro NC</p>
            <p class="about">This is a hobby project that I thought you might like. I have missed seeing some great artists at Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, NC because many are up and coming so I don't know their sound. Fumbling through the site and then researching the sound was too time consuming for me. This site links directly with Catscradle.com so you see upcoming acts linked directly to their music.</p>
            <ul class="instructions">
                <li>Main acts are in large white text. Hover over the text and a red play button appears.</li>
                <li>Opening acts are in smaller blue text. Click to hear them too.</li>
                <li>Buy Tickets takes you directly to Catscradle.com so you can see prices and purchase.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="signoff">I hope you enjoy and please send any ideas for improvement. — Bill</p>
