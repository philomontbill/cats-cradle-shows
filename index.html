            <h1>Local Soundcheck™</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Currently featuring: Cat's Cradle, Carrboro NC and Mohawk, Austin TX</p>
            <div class="venue-selector">
                <button class="venue-btn active" data-venue="catscradle">Cat's Cradle</button>

            <p class="about">I've missed great artists at Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, NC because many are up and coming and I don't recognize their name or music. Previewing their music took too much time. This site solves that with one click to hear any artist on YouTube.</p>
            <ul class="instructions">
                <li>Main acts are in large white text. Hover and a red play button appears.</li>
                <li>Opening acts are in smaller blue text. Click to hear them too.</li>
                <li>Get Tickets takes you directly back to the venue's website for prices and purchase. (BTW I'm not in the middle of any of this. It's a totally free service for you.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="about">I'm kicking this off using YouTube for music search for two reasons: 1) That's where very new acts are most likely to have content. 2) What's the use of putting a ton of time into adding links to Bandcamp, Spotify and others until I see there's interest? Just sayin.</p>
            <p class="signoff">I hope you enjoy. Send any ideas for improvement. — Bill</p>
