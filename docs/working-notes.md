### Decisions Made
- Mission: "Nothing compares to the experience of discovering a fresh talent in the intimacy of a small venue. Local Soundcheck is committed to helping you find great talent and to helping that new talent grow."
- Focus on small and mid-size venues only (no arenas/amphitheaters)
- No hard capacity number — "venues where audiences are likely to encounter artists they don't already know"
- Green field validated — competitive research of 15+ platforms confirmed no one combines venue-first browsing + small venue focus + instant samples
- Prove concept in Triangle before expanding
- Zero budget until proof of concept
- Artist outreach: ask if they see value, not a sales pitch
- Use Gmail as central hub for all Local Soundcheck email
- Reddit: post as NC_Brady (personal account), not a branded account

### Accessibility Audit — Completed (Feb 19)
Full WCAG 2.1 AA audit completed. 13 issues found across index.html, styles.css, and app.js.

### WCAG 2.1 AA Remediation — Implemented Feb 20, 2026
All 13 accessibility issues from the Feb 19 audit were implemented and verified on Feb 20, 2026. Files modified: index.html, styles.css, app.js.

**Critical (blocks keyboard/screen reader users) — all resolved:**
1. Show cards keyboard-accessible — `.show-header` and `.opener-name.has-video` have `tabindex="0"`, `role="button"`, `aria-label`, and Enter/Space keydown handlers
2. Skip navigation link — "Skip to shows" link added at top of page, hidden until focused
3. No-preview popup is a proper modal — `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, focus trap, Escape key close, `aria-label` on close button, focus returns to triggering element on close
4. YouTube iframes have `title` attribute — `title="YouTube video player for [artist]"`

**Serious — all resolved:**
5. Venue buttons have `aria-pressed` — toggled dynamically on venue switch
6. `aria-live="polite"` region — stats div announces content changes when venue switches
7. Play icon (▶) has `aria-hidden="true"` — parent elements use `aria-label` instead
8. Ticket links have `aria-label` — includes artist name and "(opens in new tab)"
9. "Beyond the Triangle" section moved before `</footer>` — correct document order

**Moderate — all resolved:**
10. Custom `:focus-visible` styles — blue (#5cacee) outline visible on dark background
11. Venue buttons wrapped in `<nav>` — `aria-label="Triangle venues"` and `aria-label="Other cities"`
12. Loading spinner has `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`
13. Mobile venue button touch targets increased — padding raised to 10px 16px

**Additional improvement (Feb 20, 2026):**
- YouTube embeds now autoplay when opened (`&autoplay=1`), eliminating an extra click for all users

### Operations Automation — Implemented Feb 20, 2026

Three automation scripts built and integrated into the GitHub Actions nightly scrape workflow:

**1. Scrape monitoring (`monitor_scrapes.py`)**
- Compares show counts to previous run (history stored in `logs/scrape-history.json`)
- Logs every run to `logs/scrape-report.txt`
- Alerts on: zero shows returned, 50%+ drop from previous scrape, JSON parse failures
- Tested locally — all 11 venues healthy on first run

**2. Expanded validation (`validate_shows.py`)**
- Original 5 checks expanded to 12+
- New checks: cancelled/postponed keywords, tour names in artist field, duplicate artists across venues (normalization), missing date/venue/ticket URL, missing images
- Separates warnings (need review) from info (low priority)
- Currently catches 42 warnings and 47 info items across 11 venues

**3. Show expiration (`expire_shows.py`)**
- Marks past shows with `"expired": true` — preserves data for historical reference
- Recalculates `total_shows`, `shows_with_video`, `shows_with_image` to exclude expired
- `app.js` filters expired shows from display
- First run flagged 8 expired shows across 3 venues (boweryballroom, elclub, motorco)

**GitHub Actions workflow updated:**
- All three scripts run after scrapers in nightly workflow
- Creates a GitHub Issue labeled `scrape-alert` when monitor or validation flags issues
- GitHub emails notification automatically (no Gmail app password needed)
- Note: Gmail app password setup was blocked by Google 2FA configuration issue — GitHub Issues used as alternative

**Design decisions (Feb 20):**
- Alerts: log everything, email/notify only on failures
- Thresholds: zero shows OR 50%+ drop triggers alert
- Past shows: flag with `expired: true`, don't delete (preserve historical data)
- Validation: log + notify on warnings, don't block data from going live
- Timing: quick checks after each scrape, plus scripts available for manual runs

### GA4 Event Tracking — Implemented Feb 20, 2026

Custom GA4 events added to app.js. Confirmed working via GA4 Realtime view.

| Event | Parameters | Fires when |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| `venue_switch` | venue_name | User clicks a different venue |
| `sample_play` | artist, venue_name, role (headliner/opener) | User plays a YouTube sample |
| `ticket_click` | artist, venue_name, ticket_url | User clicks Get Tickets |

All events include `venue_name` for per-venue reporting. This enables future venue pitch: "we drove X ticket clicks to your site."

GA4 reporting location: Reports > Business objectives > View user engagement & retention > Events

### Strategy Doc Updated — Feb 20, 2026
- Phase 2 expanded with 6 operational areas that must scale (data quality, YouTube curation, scraper maintenance, venue onboarding, inbound comms, daily checklist)
- Operations backlog added: YouTube auto-matching (needs API key) and daily digest (needs email delivery solution)

### Key Files (updated)
- docs/strategy.md — strategy document (expanded with Phase 2 operations)
- docs/outreach-templates.md — email and DM templates
- docs/strategy-discussion.txt — raw old conversation (reference only)
- outreach/summary.txt — contact list
- outreach/emails/ — 13 personalized emails
- outreach/instagram_dms.txt — DM targets
- outreach/reddit-post-triangle.txt — ready-to-post Reddit content
- generate_outreach.py — script to regenerate outreach emails
- monitor_scrapes.py — scrape health monitoring
- validate_shows.py — show data validation (expanded)
- expire_shows.py — past show expiration
- logs/scrape-history.json — previous scrape counts (auto-generated)
- logs/scrape-report.txt — scrape monitoring log (auto-generated)

### Chrome Extension
- Not connecting to Claude Code this session — troubleshoot next time

### Notes
- YouTube autoplay (`&autoplay=1`) does not work on mobile — browser-level restriction, not a bug
- VS Code Live Preview blocks YouTube embeds (bot detection) — use localhost:8000 for testing video playback
- Google 2FA enabled on Gmail account (Feb 20) but app passwords page was inaccessible — retry later
